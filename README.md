# 📶 5G Launch Impact Analysis – Wavecon Telecom

## 🧑‍💻 Overview

As part of the `#codebasicsvirtualinternship` project, I analyzed the effect of the 5G rollout on Wavecon Telecom's revenue and plan performance across multiple regions. This report evaluates post-launch KPIs, pinpoints shifts in plan performance, and delivers strategic recommendations.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Assess the **overall impact of 5G** on telecom revenue
- Identify **underperforming KPIs**
- Highlight **top-performing and low-performing plans**
- Provide recommendations for plan continuity or phase-outs

| Revenue     | ₹16.0bn   | ₹15.9bn  | ▼0.50%    |
| ARPU        | ₹200.7    | ₹200.7   | No change |
| TAU         | 161.7M    | 161.7M   | No change |

## 🏆 Plans Performing Well Post-5G

| City   | Revenue Before | Revenue After | % Change |
|--------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Delhi  | ₹1,928M        | ₹1,944M       | +0.83%   |
| Mumbai | ₹2,444M        | ₹2,452M       | +0.31%   |

These cities show healthy adoption of 5G services—ideal for promotional campaigns and upselling.

## ⚠️ Plans Underperforming Post-5G

| City       | Revenue Before | Revenue After | % Change |
|------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Jaipur     | ₹712M          | ₹697M          | -2.11%   |
| Chennai    | ₹1,494M        | ₹1,470M        | -1.61%   |
| Hyderabad  | ₹1,188M        | ₹1,169M        | -1.60%   |
| Pune       | ₹1,308M        | ₹1,290M        | -1.37%   |

These plans are negatively affected and require reassessment of pricing, network performance, or competition factors.
